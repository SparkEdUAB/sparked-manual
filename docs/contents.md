The above page is for the `dashboard` and it is called school management, here you can `add` different schools, `delete` schools and  `edit` schools.  
### Add School
The New button next to delete allows the Administrator to add a new school, when clicked it brings a simple form to add `Name of School`, ` School Code` as shown in the picture below.

Just like when Adding School, when you are done editing school details, you click the save button to update the edits, and you will have new changes saved.   



## Programs 

Adding a program under a school is basically the same procedure as adding a school, the administrator however should keep in mind that the program falls under the selected school, below is the page that shows programs, Managing (`Adding`, `Editing` and `Removing`) is the same as for School  

There is slight difference when adding a program, there is `program duration`, this is how long does the program lasts, like e.g: Nursing can take 4years(Most programs do);
Under Programs page, you have a button to take you back to Schools anytime you want to.
