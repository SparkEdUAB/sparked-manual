## SparkEd V1.8.0 Released

This is a major release since 1.8.0

We considered our users and long time spent on the screen and decided to implement the dark mode(Night mode), not only does it look good even during the day but it doesn't strain the eyes and saves battery power.

Other changes included in this version is the stats page, this shows how many contents **SparkEd** has, the contents are categorized in the following order:  

- Users
- Courses(Grades)
- Units
- Topics
- Resources
- References 

The dashboard now shows a total number in each category, this helps the administrator know how much contents has been created in SparkEd, in V3.0 these will be categorized further like under **Resources** we will be able to show how many videos or how many pdf there are.  

The following are the major commits to this release:
