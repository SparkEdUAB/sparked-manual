We are pleased to let you know that we will soon be releasing version 1.0.0 of our SparkEd platform. 

Project was inspired from working on a variety of educational programs in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade where lack of access to educational resources and poor and/or expensive internet remain challenges. After working with a number of different platforms, we could not find one with flexibility to add local content (which in many cases is extensive and well developed) organized aroud local curriculum.
