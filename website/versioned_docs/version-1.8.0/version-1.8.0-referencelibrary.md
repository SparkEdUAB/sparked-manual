## General Reference Library 
 

This is a page that displays all resources that have been uploaded and may or may not belong to any specific course Unit or Topic.  These could have been added under a course Unit or Topic like the ones [uploaded from here](contents.md#adding-general-references-resources) will be categorized by the course under which they were added.  If they were not added under a specific course they will categorized as Anonymous.

This could be viewed as a general library to compliment the organized specific content in the overall education resource being developed.  Content-Managers can directly upload resources here in the same file formats as mentioned above in [Adding Resource](contents.md#resources).

By default the page displays `10` resources but this can be changed in the top right corner.  The numbers range from `5` to `20` per page; further resources may be added but will be catalogued and paginated on further pages.  

`Content-Managers` and `Administrators` can click on each listed resource to quickly preview  the resource as shown in the screenshot below.  Resources may also either be `deleted` or `modified` by changing their names.

As the above picture shows, the Admin or content-manager is still in the Dashboard, it's a convenient way for content-managers to view the uploaded files without going through the end-users pages.
