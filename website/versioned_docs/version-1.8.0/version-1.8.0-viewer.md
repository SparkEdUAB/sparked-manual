This page displays the previously selected resource, it will display according to the format of the resource.    
This is basically like the [reference library viewer](reference.md#viewing-references), the only difference is that on the right side it will list all other resources that are under the same topic.  

The screenshot below shows an example of an image displayed, and on the side showing other resources.

When an image is displayed, you can click on it to view it in full screen mode, the image will be opened wide and the name of the image will be displayed at the bottom of the page.  
The screenshot below shows an example.
