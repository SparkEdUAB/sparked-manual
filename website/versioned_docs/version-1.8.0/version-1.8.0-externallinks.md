This is the page where Administrators and Content-Managers can see and add external links. They can be offline websites that are kept on the server for easy access that can be used as references by students, like `Wikipedia`, `Khan-Academy` and many others that are available as downloads. These can also be internet websites (if there is connectivity available).  Just like other pages with this structure the links can be either `deleted`, `edited` or `added`. The screenshot below shows the External Links page.

As of now the external links are not indexed for search but this feature will be added soon.
