## Stats   (*`new in v1.8`*) 

SparkEd has many resources spread across and for the administrators to keep count of how many they are, they can use the Stats Page for checking the numbers of all those resources.  
The displayed contents are the following: 

- List of all users
- List of all courses/grades   
- List of all units  
- List of all topics  
- List of all resources  
- List of all references  

The screenshot below show the stats page and the current count, you don't have to do anything in this page, it is just to keep track of numbers.
