## Student Usage  

This section is only active if User Authentication is enabled.  
These reports are organized around 2 pages.    
The first page lists all users who have accessed at least the home page. This shows the full name, the email and gender.

The second page is generated by clicking on the name of the user list and all pages that the user visited will be displayed as well as the time they visited that page and how many times that page was visited by the same user.

![Export Usage](assets/statistics.png)  

The **Export** button allows the Admin to `download` a csv file of a user's usage and view it in an external application like Microsoft excel or Google Sheets.
