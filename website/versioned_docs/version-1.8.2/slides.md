## Home Page Graphics  

The Home Page for Users has a gliding slide section that shows them different images which change every few seconds.
Administrators can upload different images that will be shown.  These images can be anything such as `institution pictures` (buildings, students, teachers, activities, etc) `announcements`, `events` or any designed or downloaded graphics including student designed graphics that Administrators would want delivered to Users (Students).

The screenshot below shows the cataloguing page.

Just like other pages for administrators, the slides can be `uploaded` from here, `deleted` and their names can be changed.  
The uploaded image is shown once loaded, this helps Administrators confirm the images immediately after uploading them.  

**Note**: This page is only modifiable by those with **Administrator privileges**.
