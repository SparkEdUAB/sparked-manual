## Home Page

As Described in the [Setup](setup.md) SparkEd will be structured depending on how the admin decided,  Initially it will display the courses or subjects but in case the institution has a wide range of schools it will display them all on the home page and as a user you will be able to choose which school and program you want to see courses for.   
One thing to note on Home Page, there is a slide of images, these are shown at an interval of 5seconds, the images are added by an administrator.

below are the screenshots for the different parts of the Home Page
