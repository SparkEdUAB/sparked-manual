## User Feedback  

Users may provide feedback to the Admin from different pages. Feedback is assigned to a specific user if User Authentication is enabled. If User Authentication is disabled, users will still be able to send their feedback which will labeled as anonymous.
 

Feedback is sent with the page of origin tagged which helps the Admin to easily go to that page in case a page specific problem is identified such as an `incorrect resource`, `misspelling` or `any other concern`. The origin link can be clicked and expanded to show more information to the Admin including the feedback itself.
This is shown in the following screenshots.
