## Sync

SparkEd can be installed in a central way, which would include having a main server somewhere in one location and then other installations can fetch contents from that main server provided it is connected to the internet.

The Synchronization is done in stages, the Administrator can check the updates to see if there is anything new on the main server

### Authentication  

This page can only be accessed by the administrator and they have to authenticate with the remote server each time, This means the administrator will need to be registered on the remote server, the screenshot below shows the auth page
